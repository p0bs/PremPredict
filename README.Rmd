The `PremPredict` package helps you to generate sensible predictions for individual games or an entire season of the Premier League. 

You can find my automatically-updated Premier League predictor (that uses this codebase) on [the landing page of its repo](https://github.com/p0bs/PL-scan?tab=readme-ov-file#predicting-this-seasons-premier-league).

<br/>

## Installation

You can install the development version of PremPredict from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("p0bs/PremPredict")
```

<br/>

## Approach

I use a simplified version of [David Firth's approach](https://github.com/DavidFirth/alt3code) and data from the [Open Football repo](https://github.com/openfootball/football.json) on GitHub to predict the outcome of this season's Premier League. 

The predictions are based on a team's strength, given its performance in recent times. But how should we define 'recent'? In order to duck this question, you could choose a number of different time periods. Please note that 0.0% and 100.0% outcomes in the results do not necessarily signify certainty in their specific assessment, as: 

  * this model is typically used with more than 1,000 simulations; and more pertinently
  * this model (like all models) is imperfect (but, I think, better than no model at all)

<br/>

## Example

Here is an example analysis, using data collected towards the end of the 2024/25 season.

First, we collect, combine and tidy the results data.

```{r}
library(PremPredict)
data("example_thisSeason")

results_combined <- get_results(
  results_thisSeason = example_thisSeason, 
  seasons = 1L
  )

dim(results_combined)
```

Note that we want to look back across this season (so far) and its predecessor.

```{r}
game_latest <- calc_game_latest(results = results_combined)

results_filtered <- get_results_filtered(
  results = results_combined, 
  index_game_latest = game_latest, 
  lookback_rounds = 76L
  )

dplyr::glimpse(results_filtered)
```

The number of rows isn't 760, as some games from last year didn't feature all of our teams from this season (as three teams were promoted from the Championship).

For reference, we can see the prevailing table.

```{r, message=FALSE}
data_table_current <- example_thisSeason |> 
  calc_table_current()

data_table_current |> 
  print_table_current()
```

We can now model the strengths of the sides at home and away.

```{r}
data_model <- results_filtered |> 
  model_prepare_frame() |>
  model_run()

data_model
```

[I will add further details and more explanation in due course.]

Next, we use these team strengths to model future games across the season.

```{r}
data_parameters_unplayed <- data_model |> 
  model_extract_parameters()

data_model_parameters_unplayed <- model_parameters_unplayed(
  results = results_filtered,
  model_parameters = data_parameters_unplayed
  )

data_points_expected_remaining <- data_model_parameters_unplayed |>  
  calc_points_expected_remaining()

calc_points_expected_total(
  table_current = data_table_current,
  points_expected = data_points_expected_remaining
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

On this basis, Liverpool look like strong favourites to win the season (which they went on to do). 

In order to project the likelihood of them becoming champions, however, we need to simulate many possible outcomes.

```{r}
number_simulations <- 100000

data_simulate_games <- simulate_games(
  data_model_parameters_unplayed = data_model_parameters_unplayed,
  value_number_sims = number_simulations,
  value_seed = 2602L
  )

data_simulate_standings <- simulate_standings(
  data_game_simulations = data_simulate_games,
  data_table_latest = data_table_current
  )

simulate_outcomes(
  data_standings_simulations = data_simulate_standings,
  value_number_sims = number_simulations
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

Alternatively, this table can be generated, without calculating all intermediate steps, by running the following code. (Note that the code for `|> knitr::kable()` is purely for presentational purposes.)

```{r}
run_simulations(
  results_thisSeason = example_thisSeason, 
  number_seasons = 1L, 
  lookback_rounds = 78L, 
  number_simulations = 100000, 
  value_seed = 2602L
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```
