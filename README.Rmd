The `PremPredict` package helps you to generate sensible predictions for individual games or an entire season of the Premier League. 

You can find my automatically-updated Premier League predictor (that uses this codebase) on [the landing page of its repo](https://github.com/p0bs/PL-scan?tab=readme-ov-file#predicting-this-seasons-premier-league).

<br/>

## Installation

You can install the development version of PremPredict from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("p0bs/PremPredict")
```

<br/>

## Approach

I use a simplified version of [David Firth's approach](https://github.com/DavidFirth/alt3code) and data from the [Open Football repo](https://github.com/openfootball/football.json) on GitHub to predict the outcome of this season's Premier League. 

The predictions are based on a team's strength, given its performance in recent times. But how should we define *recent*? In order to duck this question, you could choose a number of different time periods. Please note that 0.0% and 100.0% outcomes in the results do not necessarily signify certainty in their specific assessment, as: 

  * this model uses 100,000 simulations and not 1,000; and more pertinently
  * this model (like all models) is imperfect (but, I think, better than no model at all)
