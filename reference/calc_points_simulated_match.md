# Calculate the result of one match, given model parameters and a uniform random variate.

This function takes the relevant outcome probabilities for a match and
calculates its projected result based upon the outcome of a random
number generator.

## Usage

``` r
calc_points_simulated_match(
  data_model_parameters_unplayed_slim,
  randoms,
  number_sims,
  value_match
)
```

## Arguments

- data_model_parameters_unplayed_slim:

  These are the model parameters assigned to unplayed matches in this
  Premier League season, as generated by `model_parameters_unplayed`,
  with appropriate columns retained.

- randoms:

  This is a vector of uniformly-distributed random numbers, with a
  length of the product of the number of remaining matches and the
  number of simulations.

- number_sims:

  This is the number of simulations to use for each game in the
  remaining season. Defaults to 50,000.

- value_match:

  This is the simulated match to choose within the `randoms` vector of
  many simulated matches.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
calc_points_simulated_match(
  data_model_parameters_unplayed_slim = data_model_parameters_unplayed,
  randoms = data_randoms,
  number_sims = value_number_sims,
  value_match = 1L
  )
} # }
```
