# Show the likelihoods of all possible standings for all clubs over this Premier League season.

This function takes the relevant data from the simulations and the
current table to the likelihoods of all possible standings for all clubs
over this Premier League season.

## Usage

``` r
simulate_outcomes(data_standings_simulations, value_number_sims)
```

## Arguments

- data_standings_simulations:

  These are the standings for each club in each scenario run, as
  generated by `simulate_standings`.

- value_number_sims:

  This is the number of simulations to use for each game in the
  remaining season. Defaults to 50,000.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
simulate_outcomes(
  data_standings_simulations = data_standings_simulations,
  value_number_sims = 1000000
  )
} # }
```
