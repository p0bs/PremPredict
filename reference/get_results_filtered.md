# Get the Premier League results for the desired seasons

This function takes the latest data on this Premier League season and
combines it with corresponding results from previous seasons, if
desired.

## Usage

``` r
get_results_filtered(results, index_game_latest, lookback_rounds)
```

## Arguments

- results:

  These are the results from this and possibly earlier seasons, as
  generated by `get_results`.

- index_game_latest:

  This is the index of the latest game played, which can be generated by
  `calc_game_latest`.

- lookback_rounds:

  This is the number of rounds of fixtures to use in a model (so 38
  would represent a whole season).

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
get_results_filtered(
  results = data_results,
  index_game_latest = 280L,
  lookback_rounds = 38L,
  )
} # }
```
