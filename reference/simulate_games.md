# Assign the model parameters for unplayed games in this Premier League season.

This function takes the relevant parameters from the model and assigns
them to the approapriate teams in each remaining game of the season.

## Usage

``` r
simulate_games(
  data_model_parameters_unplayed,
  value_number_sims = 50000,
  value_seed = 120519L
)
```

## Arguments

- data_model_parameters_unplayed:

  These are the model parameters assigned to unplayed games in this
  Premier League season, as generated by `model_parameters_unplayed`.

- value_number_sims:

  This is the number of simulations to use for each game in the
  remaining season. Defaults to 50,000.

- value_seed:

  This is the seed to use for the random numbers in the simulation.
  Defaults to 120519 (which, IMHO, was a great footballing day).

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
simulate_games(
  data_model_parameters_unplayed = data_model_parameters_unplayed,
  value_number_sims = 1000000,
  value_seed = 120519L
  )
} # }
```
